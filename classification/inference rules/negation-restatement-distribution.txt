    Notes:
        ***NEGATION DOES NOT EXIST- at least not the way we were talking about it.
            we had transposition hididng behind an iff, and a de morgans law example
            obv it would be difficult to group different rules together--test all/none
            --are any rules more important than others?
        RESTATEMENT--technically all the "replacement rules" from ubc are RESTATEMENT
            -can't find examples in the muddy dog problemn
        DISTRIBUTION--has it's own rule already, in the table, again asks "is this rule necessary to include"


    moving forward:
        do we include more rules, like de morgan's? --> 6 ubc rules for restatement/replacement that we haven't really touched
    
    # of assumptions
        1: de morgans, commutation, double negation
        2: association, distribution, exportation

    Related topics:
        material equivalence
            -this rule closely relates to the conversion of iff statements that we discussed testing already
            -add/replace/ignore?
